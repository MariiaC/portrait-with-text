        Agatha Christie Murder on the Orient Express Part I. The Facts 1. An
        Important Passenger on the Taurus Express It was five o’clock on a
        winter’s morning in Syria. Alongside the platform at Aleppo stood the
        train grandly designated in railway guides as the Taurus Express. It
        consisted of a kitchen and dining-car, a sleeping-car and two local
        coaches. By the step leading up into the sleeping-car stood a young
        French lieutenant, resplendent in uniform conversing, with a small man
        muffled up to the ears of whom nothing was visible but a pink-tipped
        nose and the two points of an upward-curled moustache. It was freezingly
        cold, and this job of seeing off a distinguished stranger was not one to
        be envied, but Lieutenant Dubose performed his part manfully. Graceful
        phrases fell from his lips in polished French. Not that he knew what it
        was all about. There had been rumours, of course, as there always were
        in such cases. The General’s - his General’s - temper had grown worse
        and worse. And then there had come this Belgian stranger - all the way
        from England, it seemed. There had been a week - a week of curious
        tensity. And then certain things had happened. A very distinguished
        officer had committed suicide, another had suddenly resigned, anxious
        faces had suddenly lost their anxiety, certain military precautions were
        relaxed. And the General, Lieutenant Dubose’s own particular General,
        had suddenly looked ten years younger. Dubose had overheard part of a
        conversation between him and the stranger. “You have saved us, mon
        cher,” said the General emotionally, his great white moustache trembling
        as he spoke. “You have saved the honour of the French Army - you have
        averted much bloodshed! How can I thank you for acceding to my request?
        To have come so far-” To which the stranger (by name M. Hercule Poirot)
        had made a fitting reply including the phrase - “But indeed, do I not
        remember that once you saved my life?” And then the General had made
        another fitting reply to that, disclaiming any merit for that past
        service; and with more mention of France, of Belgium, of glory, of
        honour and of such kindred things they had embraced each other heartily
        and the conversation had ended. As to what it had all been about,
        Lieutenant Dubose was still in the dark, but to him had been delegated
        the duty of seeing off M. Poirot by the Taurus Express, and he was
        carrying it out with all the zeal and ardour befitting a young officer
        with a promising career ahead of him. “To-day is Sunday,” said
        Lieutenant Dubose. “Tomorrow, Monday evening, you will be in Stamboul.”
        It was not the first time he had made this observation. Conversations on
        the platform, before the departure of a train, are apt to be somewhat
        repetitive in character. “That is so,” agreed M. Poirot. “And you intend
        to remain there a few days, I think?” “Mais oui. Stamboul, it is a city
        I have never visited. It would be a pity to pass through - comme ^a.” He
        snapped his fingers descriptively. “Nothing presses - I shall remain
        there as a tourist for a few days.” “La Sainte Sophie, it is very fine,”
        said Lieutenant Dubose, who had never seen it. A cold wind came
        whistling down the platform. Both men shivered. Lieutenant Dubose
        managed to cast a surreptitious glance at his watch. Five minutes to
        five - only five minutes more! Fancying that the other man had noticed
        his glance, he hastened once more into speech. “There are few people
        travelling this time of year,” he said, glancing up at the windows of
        the sleeping-car above them. “That is so,” agreed M. Poirot. “Let us
        hope you will not be snowed up in the Taurus!” “That happens?” “It has
        occurred, yes. Not this year, as yet.” “Let us hope, then,” said M.
        Poirot. “The weather reports from Europe, they are bad. “Very bad. In
        the Balkans there is much snow.” “In Germany, too, I have heard.” “Eh
        bien,” said Lieutenant Dubose hastily as another pause seemed to be
        about to occur. “Tomorrow evening at seven-forty you will be in
        Constantinople.” “Yes,” said M. Poirot, and went on desperately, “La
        Sainte Sophie, I have heard it is very fine.” “Magnificent, I believe.”
        Above their heads the blinds of one of the sleeping-car compartments was
        pushed aside and a young woman looked out. Mary Debenham had had little
        sleep since she left Baghdad on the preceding Thursday. Neither in the
        train to Kirkuk, nor in the Rest House at Mosul, nor last night on the
        train had she slept properly. Now, weary of lying wakeful in the hot
        stuffiness of her overheated compartment, she got up and peered out.
        This must be Aleppo. Nothing to see, of course. Just a long, poorly
        lighted platform with loud, furious altercations in Arabic going on
        somewhere. Two men below her window were talking French. One was a
        French officer, the other was a little man with enormous moustaches. She
        smiled faintly. She had never seen anyone quite so heavily muffled up.
        It must be very cold outside. That was why they heated the train so
        terribly. She tried to force the window down lower, but it would not go.
        The Wagon Lit conductor had come up to the two men. The train was about
        to depart, he said. Monsieur had better mount. The little man removed
        his hat. What an egg-shaped head he had! In spite of her preoccupations
        Mary Debenham smiled. A ridiculous-looking little man. The sort of
        little man one could never take seriously. Lieutenant Dubose was saying
        his parting speech. He had thought it out beforehand and had kept it
        till the last minute. It was a very beautiful, polished speech. Not to
        be outdone, M. Poirot replied in kind... “En voiture, Monsieur,” said
        the Wagon Lit conductor. With an air of infinite reluctance M. Poirot
        climbed aboard the train. The conductor climbed after him. M. Poirot
        waved his hand. Lieutenant Dubose came to the salute. The train, with a
        terrific jerk, moved slowly forward. “Enfinl” murmured M. Hercule
        Poirot. “Brrrrrrrr,” said Lieutenant Dubose, realising to the full how
        cold he was. “Voila, Monsieur !” The conductor displayed to Poirot with
        a dramatic gesture the beauty of his sleeping compartment and the neat
        arrangement of his luggage. “The little valise of Monsieur, I have put
        it here.” His outstretched hand was suggestive. Hercule Poirot placed in
        it a folded note. “Merci, Monsieur ” The conductor became brisk and
        business-like. “I have the tickets of Monsieur. I will also take the
        passport, please. Monsieur breaks his journey in Stamboul, I
        understand?” M. Poirot assented. “There are not many people travelling,
        I imagine?” he said. “No, Monsieur. I have only two other passengers -
        both English. A Colonel fromlndia and a young English lady fromBaghdad.
        Monsieur requires anything?” Monsieur demanded a small bottle of
        Perrier. Five o’clock in the morning is an awkward time to board a
        train. There were still two hours before dawn. Conscious of an
        inadequate night’s sleep, and of a delicate mission successfully
        accomplished, M. Poirot curled up in a corner and fell asleep. When he
        awoke it was half-past nine he sallied forth to the restaurant car in
        search of hot coffee. There was only one occupant at the moment,
        obviously the young English lady referred to by the conductor. She was
        tall, slim and dark - perhaps twenty- eight years of age. There was a
        kind of cool efficiency in the way she was eating her breakfast and in
        the way she called to the attendant to bring her more coffee which
        bespoke a knowledge of the world and of travelling. She wore a dark-
        coloured travelling dress of some thin material eminently suitable for
        the heated atmosphere of the train. M. Hercule Poirot, having nothing
        better to do, amused himself by studying her without appearing to do so.
        She was, he judged, the kind of young woman who could take care of
        herself with perfect ease wherever she went. She had poise and
        efficiency. He rather liked the severe regularity of her features and
        the delicate pallor of her skin. He liked the burnished black head with
        its neat waves of hair, and her eyes - cool, impersonal and grey. But
        she was, he decided, just a little too efficient to be what he called
        “jolie femme.” Presently another person entered the restaurant car. This
        was a tall man of between forty and fifty, lean of figure, brown of
        skin, with hair slightly grizzled round the temples. “The Colonel from
        India,” said Poirot to himself. The newcomer gave a little bow to the
        girl. “Morning, Miss Debenham.” “Good morning, Colonel Arbuthnot.” The
        Colonel was standing with a hand on the chair opposite her. “Any
        objections?” he asked. “Of course not. Sit down.” “Well, you know,
        breakfast isn’t always a chatty meal.” “I should hope not. But I don’t
        bite.” The Colonel sat down. “Boy,” he called in peremptory fashion. He
        gave an order for eggs and coffee. His eyes rested for a moment on
        Hercule Poirot, but they passed on indifferently. Poirot, reading the
        English mind correctly, knew that he had said to himself. “Only some
        damned foreigner.” True to their nationality, the two English people
        were not chatty. They exchanged a few brief remarks and presently the
        girl rose and went back to her compartment. At lunch time the other two
        again shared a table and again they both completely ignored the third
        passenger. Their conversation was more animated than at breakfast.
        Colonel Arbuthnot talked of thePunjab and occasionally asked the girl a
        few questions aboutBaghdad where, it became clear, she had been in a
        post as governess. In the course of conversation they discovered some
        mutual friends, which had the immediate effect of making them more
        friendly and less stiff. They discussed old Tommy Somebody and old
        Reggie Someone Else. The Colonel inquired whether she was going straight
        through to England or whether she was stopping in Stamboul. “No, I’m
        going straight on.” “Isn’t that rather a pity?” “I came out this way two
        years ago and spent three days in Stamboul then.” “Oh! I see. Well, I
        may say I’m very glad you are going right through, because I am.” He
        made a kind of clumsy little bow, flushing a little as he did so. “He is
        susceptible, our Colonel,” thought Hercule Poirot to himself with some
        amusement. “The train, it is as dangerous as a sea voyage!” Miss
        Debenham said evenly that that would be very nice. Her manner was
        slightly repressive. The Colonel, Hercule Poirot noticed, accompanied
        her back to her compartment. Later they passed through the magnificent
        scenery of the Taurus. As they looked down towards the Cilician Gates,
        standing in the corridor side by side, a sigh came suddenly from the
        girl. Poirot was standing near them and heard her murmur: “It’s so
        beautiful! I wish - I wish-” “Yes?” “I wish I could enjoy it!” Arbuthnot
        did not answer. The square line of his jaw seemed a little sterner and
        grimmer. “I wish to Heaven you were out of all this,” he said. “Hush,
        please. Hush.” “Oh! it’s all right.” He shot a slightly annoyed glance
        in Poirot’s direction. Then he went on: “But I don’t like the idea of
        your being a governess - at the beck and call of tyrannical mothers and
        their tiresome brats.” She laughed with just a hint of uncontrol in the
        sound. “Oh! you mustn’t think that. The downtrodden governess is quite
        an exploded myth. I can assure you that it’s the parents who are afraid
        of being bullied by me.” They said no more. Arbuthnot was, perhaps,
        ashamed of his outburst. “Rather an odd little comedy that I watch
        here,” said Poirot to himself thoughtfully. He was to remember that
        thought of his later. They arrived at Konya that night about half-past
        eleven. The two English travellers got out to stretch their legs, pacing
        up and down the snowy platform. M. Poirot was content to watch the
        teeming activity of the station through a window pane. After about ten
        minutes, however, he decided that a breath of air would not perhaps be a
        bad thing after all. He made careful preparations, wrapping himself in
        several coats and mufflers and encasing his neat boots in goloshes. Thus
        attired, he descended gingerly to the platform and began to pace its
        length. He walked out beyond the engine. It was the voices which gave
        him the clue to the two indistinct figures standing in the shadow of a
        traffic van. Arbuthnot was speaking. “Mary-” The girl interrupted him.
        “Not now. Not now. When it’s all over. When it’s behind us - then-”
        Discreetly M. Poirot turned away. He wondered... He would hardly have
        recognised the cool, efficient voice of Miss Debenham... “Curious,” he
        said to himself. The next day he wondered whether, perhaps, they had
        quarrelled. They spoke little to each other. The girl, he thought,
        looked anxious. There were dark circles under her eyes. It was about
        half-past two in the afternoon when the train came to a halt. Heads were
        poked out of windows. A little knot of men were clustered by the side of
        the line looking and pointing at something under the dining-car. Poirot
        leaned out and spoke to the Wagon Lit conductor who was hurrying past.
        The man answered, and Poirot drew back his head and, turning, almost
        collided with Mary Debenham who was standing just behind him. “What is
        the matter?” she asked rather breathlessly in French. “Why are we
        stopping?” “It is nothing, Mademoiselle. It is something that has caught
        fire under the dining-car. Nothing serious. It is put out. They are now
        repairing the damage. There is no danger, I assure you.” She made a
        little abrupt gesture, as though she were waving the idea of danger
        aside as something completely unimportant. “Yes, yes, I understand that.
        But the time!” “The time?” “Yes, this will delay us.” “It is possible -
        yes,” agreed Poirot. “But we can’t afford delay! This train is due in at
        6.55, and one has to cross the Bosphorus and catch the Simplon Orient
        Express on the other side at nine o’clock. If there is an hour or two of
        delay we shall miss the connection.” “It is possible, yes,” he admitted.
        He looked at her curiously. The hand that held the window bar was not
        quite steady; her lips, too, were trembling. “Does it matter to you very
        much, Mademoiselle?” he asked. “Yes. Yes, it does. I - I must catch that
        train.” She turned away from him and went down the corridor to join
        Colonel Arbuthnot. Her anxiety, however, was needless. Ten minutes later
        the train started again. It arrived at Hayda-passar only five minutes
        late, having made up time on the journey. The Bosphorus was rough and M.
        Poirot did not enjoy the crossing. He was separated from his travelling
        companions on the boat and did not see them again. On arrival at the
        Galata Bridge he drove straight to the Tokatlian Hotel. 2. The Tokatlian
        Hotel At the Tokatlian, Hercule Poirot asked for a room with bath. Then
        he stepped over to the concierge’s desk and inquired for letters. There
        were three waiting for him and a telegram. His eyebrows rose a little at
        the sight of the telegram. It was unexpected. He opened it in his usual
        neat, unhurried fashion. The printed words stood out clearly.
        Development you predicted in Kassner case has come unexpectedly. Please
        return immediately. “Voila ce qui est embetant,” muttered Poirot
        vexedly. He glanced up at the clock. “I shall have to go on to-night,”
        he said to the concierge. “At what time does the Simplon Orient leave?”
        “At nine o’clock, Monsieur.” “Can you get me a sleeper?” “Assuredly,
        Monsieur. There is no difficulty this time of year. The trains are
        almost empty. First-class or second?” “First.” “Tres bien, Monsieur. How
        far are you going?” “To London.” “Bien, Monsieur. I will get you a
        ticket to London and reserve your sleeping- car accommodation in the
        Stamboul-Calais coach.” Poirot glanced at the clock again. It was ten
        minutes to eight. “I have time to dine?” “But assuredly, Monsieur.” The
        little Belgian nodded. He went over and cancelled his room order and
        crossed the hall to the restaurant. As he was giving his order to the
        waiter, a hand was placed on his shoulder. “Ah, mon vieux, but this is
        an unexpected pleasure!” said a voice behind him. The speaker was a
        short stout elderly man, his hair cut en brosse. He was smiling
        delightedly. Poiret sprang up. “M. Bouc!” “M. Poirot!” M. Bouc was a
        Belgian, a director of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits, and
        his acquaintance with the former star of the Belgian police force dated
        back many years. “You find yourself far from home, mon cher,” said M.
        Bouc. “A little affair in Syria.” “Ah! and you return home - when?”
        “To-night.” “Splendid! I, too. That is to say, I go as far as Lausanne,
        where I have affairs. You travel on the Simplon Orient, I presume?”
        “Yes. I have just asked them to get me a sleeper. It was my intention to
        remain here some days, but I have, received a telegram recalling me
        toEngland on important business.” “Ah!” sighed M. Bouc. “Les affaires -
        les affaires ! But you, you are at the top of the tree nowadays, mon
        vieuxl” “Some little success I have had, perhaps.” Hercule Poirot tried
        to look modest but failed signally. M. Bouc laughed. “We will meet
        later,” he said. Hercule Poirot addressed himself to the task of keeping
        his moustaches out of the soup. That difficult task accomplished, he
        glanced round him whilst waiting for the next course. There were only
        about half a dozen people in the restaurant, and of those half dozen
        there were only two that interested Hercule Poirot. These two sat at a
        table not far away. The younger was a likeable-looking young man of
        thirty, clearly an American. It was, however, not he but his companion
        who had attracted the little detective’s attention. He was a man perhaps
        of between sixty and seventy. From a little distance he had the bland
        aspect of a philanthropist. His slightly bald head, his domed forehead,
        the smiling mouth that displayed a very white set of false teeth - all
        seemed to speak of a benevolent personality. Only the eyes belied this
        assumption. They were small, deep-set and crafty. Not only that. As the
        man, making some remark to his young companion, glanced across the room,
        his gaze stopped on Poirot for a moment and just for that second there
        was a strange malevolence, an unnatural tensity in the glance. Then he
        rose. “Pay the bill, Hector,” he said. His voice was slightly husky in
        tone. It had a queer, soft, dangerous quality. When Poirot rejoined his
        friend in the lounge, the other two men were just leaving the hotel.
        Their luggage was being brought down. The younger was supervising the
        process. Presently he opened the glass door and said: “Quite ready now,
        Mr. Ratchett.” The elder man grunted an assent and passed out. “Eh
        bien,” said Poirot. “What do you think of those two?” “They are
        Americans,” said M. Bouc. “Assuredly they are Americans. I meant what
        did you think of their personalities?” “The young man seemed quite
        agreeable.” “And the other?” “To tell you the truth, my friend, I did
        not care for him. He produced on me an unpleasant impression. And you?”
        Hercule Poirot was a moment in replying. “When he passed me in the
        restaurant,” he said at last, “I had a curious impression. It was as
        though a wild animal - an animal savage, but savage! you understand -
        had passed me by.” “And yet he looked altogether of the most
        respectable.” “Precisement! The body - the cage - is everything of the
        most respectable - but through the bars, the wild animal looks out.”
        “You are fanciful, mon vieux,” said M. Bouc. “It may be so. But I could
        not rid myself of the impression that evil had passed me by very close.”
        “That respectable American gentleman?” “That respectable American
        gentleman.” “Well,” said M. Bouc cheerfully, “it may be so. There is
        much evil in the world.” At that moment the door opened and the
        concierge came towards them. He looked concerned and apologetic. “It is
        extraordinary, Monsieur,” he said to Poirot. “There is not one
        first-class sleeping berth to be had on the train.” “Comment?” cried M.
        Bouc. “At this time of year? Ah, without doubt there is some party of
        journalists - of politicians-?” “I don’t know, sir,” said the concierge,
        turning to him respectfully. “But that’s how it is.” “Well, well.” M.
        Bouc turned to Poirot. “Have no fear, my friend. We will arrange
        something. There is always one compartment, the No. 16, which is not
        engaged. The conductor sees to that!” He smiled, then glanced up at the
        clock. “Come,” he said, “it is time we started.” At the station M. Bouc
        was greeted with respectful empressement by the brown-uniformed Wagon
        Lit conductor. “Good evening, Monsieur. Your compartment is the No. 1.”
        He called to the porters and they wheeled their load halfway along the
        carriage on which the tin plates proclaimed its destination: ISTANBUL
        TRIESTE CALAIS “You are full up to-night, I hear?” “It is incredible,
        Monsieur. All the world elects to travel to-night!” “All the same you
        must find room for this gentleman here. He is a friend of mine. He can
        have the No. 16.” “It is taken, Monsieur.” “What? The No. 16?” A glance
        of understanding passed between them, and the conductor smiled. He was a
        tall sallow man of middle age. “But yes, Monsieur. As I told you, we are
        full - full - everywhere.” “But what passes itself?” demanded M. Bouc
        angrily. “There is a conference somewhere? It is a party?” “No,
        Monsieur. It is only chance. It just happens that many people have
        elected to travel to-night.” M. Bouc made a clicking sound of annoyance.
        “At Belgrade,” he said, “there will be the slip coach from Athens. There
        will also be the Bucharest-Paris coach. But we do not reach Belgrade
        until to-morrow evening. The problem is for to-night. There is no
        second-class berth free?” “There is a second-class berth, Monsieur-”
        “Well, then-” “But it is a lady’s berth, there is already a German woman
        in the compartment - a lady’s maid.” “La-la, that is awkward,” said M.
        Bouc. “Do not distress yourself, my friend,” said Poirot. “I must travel
        in an ordinary carriage.” “Not at all. Not at all.” He turned once more
        to the conductor. “Everyone has arrived?” “It is true,” said the man,
        “that there is one passenger who has not yet arrived.” He spoke slowly,
        with hesitation. “But speak then!” “No. 7 berth - a second-class. The
        gentleman has not yet come, and it is four minutes to nine.” “Who is
        it?” “An Englishman,” the conductor consulted his list. “A M. Harris.”
        “A name of good omen,” said Poirot. “I read my Dickens. M. Harris he
        will not arrive.” “Put Monsieur’s luggage in No. 7,” said M. Bouc. “If
        this M. Harris arrives we will tell him that he is too late - that
        berths cannot be retained so long - we will arrange the matter one way
        or another. What do I care for a M. Harris?” “As Monsieur pleases,” said
        the conductor. He spoke to Poirot’s porter, directing him where to go.
        Then he stood aside from the steps to let Poirot enter the train. “Tout
        a fait au bout, Monsieur ,” he called. “The end compartment but one.”
        Poirot passed along the corridor, a somewhat slow progress, since most
        of the people travelling were standing outside their carriages. His
        polite “Pardons” were uttered with the regularity of clockwork. At last
        he reached the compartment indicated. Inside it, reaching up to a
        suitcase, was the tall young American of the Tokatlian. He frowned as
        Poirot entered. “Excuse me,” he said. “I think you’ve made a mistake.”
        Then, laboriously in French: “Je crois qua vous avez un erreur.” Poirot
        replied in English. “You are Mr. Harris?” “No, my name is MacQueen. I-”
        But at that moment the voice of the Wagon Lit conductor spoke from over
        Poirot’s shoulder - an apologetic, rather breathless voice. “There is no
        other berth on the train, Monsieur. The gentleman has to come in here.”
        He was hauling up the corridor window as he spoke and began to lift in
        Poirot’s luggage. Poirot noticed the apology in his tone with some
        amusement. Doubtless the man had been promised a good tip if he could
        keep the compartment for the sole use of the other traveller. However,
        even the most munificent of tips lose their effect when a Director of
        the Company is on board and issues his orders. The conductor emerged
        from the compartment, having swung the suitcases up onto the racks.
        “Voila, Monsieur,” he said. “All is arranged. Yours is the upper berth,
        the No. 7. We start in one minute.” He hurried off down the corridor.
        Poirot re-entered the compartment. “A phenomenon I have seldom seen,” he
        said cheerfully. “A Wagon Lit conductor himself puts up the luggage! It
        is unheard of!” His fellow traveller smiled. He had evidently got over
        his annoyance - had probably decided that it was no good to take the
        matter otherwise than philosophically. “The train’s remarkably full,” he
        said. A whistle blew, there was a long melancholy cry from the engine.
        Both men stepped out into the corridor. Outside a voice shouted, “En
        voiture!” “We’re off,” said MacQueen. But they were not quite off. The
        whistle blew again. “I say, sir,” said the young man suddenly. “If you’d
        rather have the lower berth - easier and all that - well, that’s all
        right by me.” A likeable young fellow. “No, no,” protested Poirot. “I
        would not deprive you-” “That’s all right-” “You are too amiable-”
        Polite protests on both sides. “It is for one night only,” explained
        Poirot. “At Belgrade-” “Oh! I see. You’re getting out at Belgrade-” “Not
        exactly. You see-” There was a sudden jerk. Both men swung round to the
        window, looking out at the long lighted platform as it slid slowly past
        them. The Orient Express had started on its three-day journey across
        Europe. 3. Poirot Refuses a Case M. Hercule Poirot was a little late in
        entering the luncheon-car on the following day. He had risen early, had
        breakfasted almost alone, and had spent the morning going over the notes
        of the case that was recalling him to London. He had seen little of his
        travelling companion. M. Bouc, who was already seated, gated a greeting
        and summoned his friend to the empty place opposite him. Poirot sat down
        and soon found himself in the favoured position of being at the table
        which was served first and with the choicest morsels. The food, too, was
        unusually good. It was not till they were eating a delicate cream cheese
        that M. Bouc allowed his attention to wander to matters other than
        nourishment. He was at the stage of a meal when one becomes philosophic.
        “Ah!” he sighed. “If I had but the pen of a Balzac! I would depict this
        scene.” He waved a hand. “It is an idea, that,” said Poirot. “Ah, you
        agree? It has not been done, I think? And yet - it lends itself to
        romance, my friend. All around us are people, of all classes, of all
        nationalities, of all ages. For three days these people, these strangers
        to one another, are brought together. They sleep and eat under one roof,
        they cannot get away from each other. At the end of three days they
        part, they go their several ways, never perhaps to see each other
        again.” “And yet,” said Poirot, “suppose an accident-” “Ah, no, my
        friend-” “From your point of view it would be regrettable, I agree. But
        nevertheless let us just for one moment suppose it. Then, perhaps, all
        these here are linked together - by death.” “Some more wine,” said M.
        Bouc, hastily pouring it out. “You are morbid, mon cher. It is, perhaps
        the digestion.” “It is true,” agreed Poirot, “that the food in Syria was
        not perhaps quite suited to my stomach.” He sipped his wine. Then,
        leaning back, he ran his eye thoughtfully round the dining-car. There
        were thirteen people seated there and, as M. Bouc had said, of all
        classes and nationalities. He began to study them. At the table opposite
        them were three men. They were, he guessed, single travellers graded and
        placed there by the unerring judgment of the restaurant attendants. A
        big swarthy Italian was picking his teeth with gusto. Opposite him a
        spare neat Englishman had the expressionless disapproving face of the
        well- trained servant. Next to the Englishman was a big American in a
        loud suit - possibly a commercial traveller. “You’ve got to put it over
        big,” he was saying in a loud, nasal voice. The Italian removed his
        toothpick to gesticulate with it freely. “Sure,” he said. “That whatta I
        say alia de time.” The Englishman looked out of the window and coughed.
        Poirot’s eye passed on. At a small table, sitting very upright, was one
        of the ugliest old ladies he had ever seen. It was an ugliness of
        distinction - it fascinated rather than repelled. She sat very upright.
        Round her neck was a collar of very large pearls which, improbable
        though it seemed, were real. Her hands were covered with rings. Her
        sable coat was pushed back on her shoulders. A very small and expensive
        black toque was hideously unbecoming to the yellow, toad-like face
        beneath it. She was speaking now to the restaurant attendant in a clear,
        courteous, but completely autocratic tone. “You will be sufficiently
        amiable to place in my compartment a bottle of mineral water and a large
        glass of orange juice. You will arrange that I shall have chicken cooked
        without sauces for dinner this evening - also some boiled fish.” The
        attendant replied respectfully that it should be done. She gave a slight
        gracious nod of the head and rose. Her glance caught Poirot’s and swept
        over him with the nonchalance of the uninterested aristocrat. “That is
        Princess Dragomiroff,” said M. Bouc in a low tone. “She is a Russian.
        Her husband realised all his money before the Revolution and invested it
        abroad. She is extremely rich. A cosmopolitan.” Poirot nodded. He had
        heard of Princess Dragomiroff. “She is a personality,” said M. Bouc.
        “Ugly as sin but she makes herself felt. You agree?” Poirot agreed. At
        another of the large tables Mary Debenham was sitting with two other
        women. One of them was tall and middle-aged, in a plaid blouse and tweed
        skirt. She had a mass of faded yellow hair unbecomingly arranged in a
        large bun, wore glasses, and had a long mild amiable face rather like a
        sheep. She was listening to the third woman, a stout, pleasant-faced,
        elderly person who was talking in a slow clear monotone which showed no
        signs of pausing for breath or coming to a stop. “-and so my daughter
        said, 'Why,’ she said, ‘you just can’t apply American methods in this
        country. It’s natural to the folks here to be indolent,’ she said. ‘They
        just haven’t got any hustle in them-’ But all the same you’d be
        surprised to know what our college there is doing. They’ve got a fine
        staff of teachers. I guess there’s nothing like education. We’ve got to
        apply our Western ideals and teach the East to recognise them. My
        daughter says-” The train plunged into a tunnel. The calm, monotonous
        voice was drowned. At the next table, a small one, sat Colonel Arbuthnot
        - alone. His gaze was fixed upon the back of Mary Debenham’s head. They
        were not sitting together. Yet it could easily have been managed. Why?
        Perhaps, Poirot thought, Mary Debenham had demurred. A governess learns
        to be careful. Appearances are important. A girl with her living to get
        has to be discreet. His glance shifted to the other side of the
        carriage. At the far end, against the wall, was a middle-aged woman
        dressed in black with a broad, expressionless face. German or
        Scandinavian, he thought. Probably the German lady’s maid. Beyond her
        were a couple leaning forward and talking animatedly together. The man
        wore English clothes of loose tweed, but he was not English. Though only
        the back of his head was visible to Poirot, the shape of it and the set
        of the shoulders betrayed him. A big man, well made. He turned his head
        suddenly and Poirot saw his profile. A very handsome man of thirty-odd
        with a big fair moustache. The woman opposite him was a mere girl -
        twenty at a guess. A tight-fitting little black coat and skirt, white
        satin blouse, small chic black toque perched at the fashionable
        outrageous angle. She had a beautiful foreign-looking face, dead white
        skin, large brown eyes, jet black hair. She was smoking a cigarette in a
        long holder. Her manicured hands had deep red nails. She wore one large
        emerald set in platinum. There was coquetry in her glance and voice.
        “Elle estjolie - et chic,” murmured Poirot. “Husband and wife - eh?” M.
        Bouc nodded. “Hungarian Embassy, I believe,” he said. “A handsome
        couple.” There were only two more lunchers - Poirot’s fellow traveller
        MacQueen and his employer Mr. Ratchett. The latter sat facing Poirot,
        and for the second time Poirot studied that unprepossessing face, noting
        the false benevolence of the brow and the small, cruel eyes. Doubtless
        M. Bouc saw a change in his friend’s expression. “It is at your wild
        animal you look?” he asked. Poirot nodded. As his coffee was brought to
        him, M. Bouc rose to his feet. Having started before Poirot he had
        finished some time ago. “I return to my compartment,” he said. “Come
        along presently and converse with me.” “With pleasure.” Poirot sipped
        his coffee and ordered a liqueur. The attendant was passing from table
        to table with his box of money, accepting payment for bills. The elderly
        American lady’s voice rose shrill and plaintive. “My daughter said:
        ‘Take a book of food tickets and you’ll have no trouble - no trouble at
        all.’ Now, that isn’t so. Seems they have to have a ten per cent tip,
        and then there’s that bottle of mineral water - and a queer sort of
        water too. They didn’t have any Evian or Vichy, which seems queer to
        me.” “It is - they must - how do you say? - serve the water of the
        country,” explained the sheep-faced lady. “Well, it seems queer to me.”
        She looked distastefully at the heap of small change on the table in
        front of her. “Look at all this peculiar stuff he’s given me. Dinars or
        something. Just a lot of rubbish, it looks like! My daughter said-” Mary
        Debenham pushed back her chair and left with a slight bow to the other
        two. Colonel Arbuthnot got up and followed her. Gathering up her
        despised money the American woman followed suit, followed by the other
        one like a sheep. The Hungarians had already departed. The restaurant
        car was empty save for Poirot and Ratchett and MacQueen. Ratchett spoke
        to his companion, who got up and left the car. Then he rose himself, but
        instead of following MacQueen he dropped unexpectedly into the seat
        opposite Poirot. “Can you oblige me with a light?” he said. His voice
        was soft - faintly nasal. “My name is Ratchett.” Poirot bowed slightly.
        He slipped his hand into his pocket and produced a matchbox which he
        handed to the other man, who took it but did not strike a light. “I
        think,” he went on, “that I have the pleasure of speaking to Mr. Hercule
        Poirot. Is that so?” Poirot bowed again. “You have been correctly
        informed, Monsieur.” The detective was conscious of those strange shrewd
        eyes summing him up before the other spoke again. “In my country,” he
        said, “we come to the point quickly. Mr. Poirot, I want you to take on a
        job for me.” Hercule Poirot’s eyebrows went up a trifle. “My clientele,
        Monsieur, is limited nowadays. I undertake very few cases.” “Why,
        naturally, I understand that. But this, Mr. Poirot, means big money.” He
        repeated again in his soft, persuasive voice, “Big money.” Hercule
        Poirot was silent a minute or two. Then he said: “What is it you wish me
        to do for you, Monsieur - er - Ratchett?” “Mr. Poirot, I am a rich man -
        a very rich man. Men in that position have enemies. I have an enemy.”
        “Only one enemy?” “Just what do you mean by that question?” asked
        Ratchett sharply. “Monsieur, in my experience when a man is in a
        position to have, as you say, enemies, then it does not usually resolve
        itself into one enemy only.” Ratchett seemed relieved by Poirot’s
        answer. He said quickly: “Why, yes, I appreciate that point. Enemy or
        enemies - it doesn’t matter. What does matter is my safety.” “Safety?”
        “My life has been threatened, Mr. Poirot. Now I’m a man who can take
        pretty good care of himself.” From the pocket of his coat his hand
        brought a small automatic into sight for a moment. He continued grimly.
        “I don’t think I’m the kind of man to be caught napping. But, as I look
        at it, I might as well make assurance doubly sure. I fancy you’re the
        man for my money, Mr. Poirot. And remember - big money.” Poirot looked
        at him thoughtfully for some minutes. His face was completely
        expressionless. The other could have had no clue as to what thoughts
        were passing in that mind. “I regret, Monsieur,” he said at length,
        “that I cannot oblige you.” The other looked at him shrewdly. “Name your
        figure, then,” he said. Poirot shook his head. “You do not understand,
        Monsieur. I have been very fortunate in my profession. I have made
        enough money to satisfy both my needs and my caprices. I take now only
        such cases as - interest me.” “You’ve got a pretty good nerve,” said
        Ratchett. “Will twenty thousand dollars tempt you?” “It will not.” “If
        you’re holding out for more, you won’t get it. I know what a thing’s
        worth to me.” “I, also, M. Ratchett.” “What’s wrong with my
        proposition?” Poirot rose. “If you will forgive me for being personal -
        I do not like your face, M. Ratchett,” he said. And with that he left
        the restaurant car. 4. A Cry in the Night The Simplon Orient Express
        arrived at Belgrade at a quarter to nine that evening. It was not due to
        depart again until 9.15, so Poirot descended to the platform. He did
        not, however, remain there long. The cold was bitter, and though the
        platform itself was protected, heavy snow was falling outside. He
        returned to his compartment. The conductor, who was on the platform
        stamping his feet and waving his arms to keep warm, spoke to him. “Your
        valises have been moved, Monsieur. To the compartment No. 1, the
        compartment of M. Bouc.” “But where is Monsieur Bouc, then?” “He has
        moved into the coach from Athens which has just been put on.” Poirot
        went in search of his friend. M. Bouc waved his protestations aside. “It
        is nothing. It is nothing. It is more convenient like this. You are
        going through to England, so it is better that you should stay in the
        through coach to Calais. Me, I am very well here. It is most peaceful.
        This coach is empty save for myself and one little Greek doctor. Ah! my
        friend, what a night! They say there has not been so much snow for
        years. Let us hope we shall not be held up. I am not too happy about it,
        I can tell you.” At 9.15 punctually the train pulled out of the station,
        and shortly afterwards Poirot got up, said good night to his friend, and
        made his way along the corridor back into his own coach which was in
        front next to the dining-car. On this, the second day of the journey,
        barriers were breaking down. Colonel Arbuthnot was standing at the door
        of his compartment talking to MacQueen. When MacQueen saw Poirot he
        broke off something he was saying. He looked very much surprised. “Why,”
        he cried, “I thought you’d left us. You said you were getting off at
        Belgrade.” “You misunderstood me,” said Poirot, smiling. “I remember
        now, the train started from Stamboul just as we were talking about it.”
        “But, man, your baggage. It’s gone.” “It has been moved into another
        compartment, that is all.” “Oh! I see.” He resumed his conversation with
        Arbuthnot, and Poirot passed on down the corridor. Two doors from his
        own compartment, the elderly American, Mrs. Hubbard, was standing
        talking to the sheep-like lady, who was a Swede. Mrs. Hubbard was
        pressing a magazine on the other. “No, do take it, my dear,” she said.
        “I’ve got plenty of other things to read. My, isn’t the cold something
        frightful?” She nodded amicably to Poirot. “You are most kind,” said the
        Swedish lady. “Not at all. I hope you’ll sleep well and that your head
        will be better in the morning.” “It is the cold only. I make now myself
        a cup of tea.” “Have you got some aspirin? Are you sure now? I’ve got
        plenty. Well, good night, my dear.” She turned to Poirot
        conversationally as the other woman departed. “Poor creature, she’s a
        Swede. As far as I can make out she’s a kind of missionary. A teaching
        one. A nice creature, but doesn’t talk much English. She was most
        interested in what I told her about my daughter.” Poirot, by now, knew
        all about Mrs. Hubbard’s daughter. Everyone on the train who could
        understand English did! How she and her husband were on the staff of a
        big American college in Smyrna, and how this was Mrs. Hubbard’s first
        journey to the East, and what she thought of the Turks and their
        slipshod ways and the condition of their roads. The door next to them
        opened and the thin pale manservant stepped out. Inside, Poirot caught a
        glimpse of Mr. Ratchett sitting up in bed. He saw Poirot and his face
        changed, darkening with anger. Then the door was shut. Mrs. Hubbard drew
        Poirot a little wide. “You know, I’m dead scared of that man. Oh! not
        the valet - the other. His master. Master, indeed! There’s something
        wrong about that man. My daughter always says I’m very intuitive. 'When
        Mamma gets a hunch, she’s dead right,’ that’s what my daughter says. And
        I’ve got a hunch about that man. He’s next door to me and I don’t like
        it. I put my grips against the communicating door last night. I thought
        I heard him trying the handle. Duo you know, I shouldn’t be a bit
        surprised if that man turned out to be a murderer - one of these train
        robbers you read about. I daresay I’m foolish, but there it is. I’m
        absolutely scared to death of the man! My daughter said I’d have an easy
        journey, but somehow I don’t feel happy about it. It may be foolish, but
        I feel as if anything might happen - anything at all. And how that nice
        young fellow can bear to be his secretary, I can’t think.” Colonel
        Arbuthnot and MacQueen were coming towards them down the corridor. “Come
        into my carriage,” MacQueen was saying. “It isn’t made up for the night
        yet. Now what I want to get right about your policy in India is this-”
        The two men passed and went on down the corridor to MacQueen’s carriage.
        Mrs. Hubbard said good night to Poirot. “I guess I’ll go right to bed
        and read,” she said. “Good night.” “Good night, Madame.” Poirot passed
        into his own compartment, which was the next one beyond Ratchett’s. He
        undressed and got into bed, read for about half an hour and then turned
        out the light. He awoke some hours later, awoke with a start. He knew
        what it was that had wakened him - a loud groan, almost a cry, somewhere
        close at hand. At the same moment the ting of a bell sounded sharply.
        Poirot sat up and switched on the light. He noticed that the train was
        at a standstill - presumably at a station. That cry had startled him. He
        remembered that it was Ratchett who had the next compartment. He got out
        of bed and opened the door just as the Wagon Lit conductor came hurrying
        along the corridor and knocked on Ratchett’s door. Poirot kept his door
        open a crack and watched. The conductor tapped a second time. A bell
        rang and a light showed over another door farther down. The conductor
        glanced over his shoulder. At the same moment a voice from within the
        next compartment called out: “Ce n’est hen. Je me suis trompe.” “Bien,
        Monsieur .” The conductor scurried off again, to knock at the door where
        the light was showing. Poirot returned to bed, his mind relieved, and
        switched off the light. He glanced at his watch. It was just
        twenty-three minutes to one. 5. The Crime He found it difficult to go to
        sleep again at once. For one thing he missed the motion of the train. If
        it was a station outside, it was curiously quiet. By contrast the noises
        on the train seemed unusually loud. He could hear Ratchett moving about
        next door - a click as he pulled down the washbasin, the sound of the
        tap mnning, a splashing noise, then another click as the basin shut to
        again. Footsteps passed up the corridor outside, the shuffling footsteps
        of someone in bedroom slippers. Hercule Poirot lay awake staring at the
        ceiling. Why was the station outside so silent? His throat felt dry. He
        had forgotten to ask for his usual bottle of mineral water. He looked at
        his watch again. Just after a quarter past one. He would ring for the
        conductor and ask for some mineral water. His finger went out to the
        bell, but he paused as in the stillness he heard a ting. The man
        couldn’t answer every bell at once. Ting... Ting... Ting... It sounded
        again and again. Where was the man? Somebody was getting impatient.
        Ti-i-i-ing! Whoever it was, was keeping a finger solidly on the
        push-button. Suddenly with a rush, his footsteps echoing up the aisle,
        the man came. He knocked at a door not far from Poirot’s own. Then came
        voices - the conductor’s, deferential, apologetic; and a woman’s,
        insistent and voluble. Mrs. Hubbard! Poirot smiled to himself. The
        altercation - if it was one - went on for some time. Its proportions
        were ninety per cent of Mrs. Hubbard’s to a soothing ten per cent of the
        conductor’s. Finally the matter seemed to be adjusted. Poirot heard
        distinctly a “Bonne nuit, Madame,” and a closing door. He pressed his
        own finger on the bell. The conductor arrived promptly. He looked hot
        and worried. “De Teau minerale, s’il vous Plait.” “Bien, Monsieur.”
        Perhaps a twinkle in Poirot’s eye led him to unburden himself. “La dame
        americaine-” “Yes?” He wiped his forehead. “Imagine to yourself the time
        I have had with her! She insists - but insists - that there is a man in
        her compartment! Figure to yourself, Monsieur. In a space of this size.”
        He swept a hand round. “Where would he conceal himself? I argue with
        her. I point out that it is impossible. She insists. She woke up, and
        there was a man there. And how, I ask, did he get out and leave the door
        bolted behind him? But she will not listen to reason. As though there
        were not enough to worry us already. This snow-” “Snow?” “But yes,
        Monsieur. Monsieur has not noticed? The train has stopped. We have run
        into a snowdrift. Heaven knows how long we shall be here. I remember
        once being snowed up for seven days.” “Where are we?” “Between Vincovci
        and Brod.” “La-la,”said Poirot vexedly. The man withdrew and returned
        with the water. “Bon soir, Monsieur .” Poirot drank a glass of water and
        composed himself to sleep. He was just dropping off when something again
        woke him. This time it was as though something heavy had fallen with a
        thud against the door. He sprang up, opened it and looked out. Nothing.
        But to his right, some distance down the corridor, a woman wrapped in a
        scarlet kimono was retreating from him. At the other end, sitting on his
        little seat, the conductor was entering up figures on large sheets of
        paper. Everything was deathly quiet. “Decidedly I suffer from the
        nerves,” said Poirot and retired to bed again. This time he slept till
        morning. When he awoke the train was still at a standstill. He raised a
        blind and looked out. Heavy banks of snow surrounded the train. He
        glanced at his watch and saw that it was past nine o’clock. At a quarter
        to ten, neat, spruce and dandified as ever, he made his way to the
        restaurant car, where a chorus of woe was going on. Any barriers there
        might have been between the passengers had now quite broken down. All
        were united by a common misfortune. Mrs. Hubbard was loudest in her
        lamentations. “My daughter said it would be the easiest way in the
        world. Just sit in the train until I got to Parrus. And now we may be
        here for days and days,” she wailed. “And my boat sails day after
        to-morrow. How am I going to catch it now? Why, I can’t even wire to
        cancel my passage. I’m just too mad to talk about it!” The Italian said
        that he had urgent business himself in Milan. The large American said
        that that was “too bad, Ma’am,” and soothingly expressed a hope that the
        train might make up time. “My sister - her children wait me,” said the
        Swedish lady, and wept. “I get no word to them. What they think? They
        will say bad things have happen to me.” “How long shall we be here?”
        demanded Mary Debenham. “Doesn’t anybody know?” Her voice sounded
        impatient, but Poirot noted that there were no signs of that almost
        feverish anxiety which she had displayed during the check to the Taurus
        Express. Mrs. Hubbard was off again. “There isn’t anybody knows a thing
        on this train. And nobody’s trying to do anything. Just a pack of
        useless foreigners. Why, if this were at home, there’d be someone at
        least trying to do something!” Arbuthnot turned to Poirot and spoke in
        careful British French. “Vous etes un directeur de la ligne, je crois,
        Monsieur. Vous pouvez nous dire-” Smiling, Poirot corrected him. “No,
        no,” he said in English. “It is not I. You confound me with my friend,
        M. Bouc.” “Oh, I’m sorry” “Not at all. It is most natural. I am now in
        the compartment that he had formerly.” M. Bouc was not present in the
        restaurant car. Poirot looked about to notice who else was absent.
        Princess Dragomiroff was missing, and the Hungarian couple. Also
        Ratchett, his valet, and the German lady’s maid. The Swedish lady wiped
        her eyes. “I am foolish,” she said. “I am bad to cry. All is for the
        best, whatever happen.” This Christian spirit, however, was far from
        being shared. “That’s all very well,” said MacQueen restlessly. “We may
        be here for days.” “What is this country anyway?” demanded Mrs. Hubbard
        tearfully. On being told it was Jugo-Slavia, she said: “Oh! one of these
        Balkan things. What can you expect?” “You are the only patient one,
        Mademoiselle,” said Poirot to Miss Debenham. She shrugged her shoulders
        slightly. “What can one do?” “You are a philosopher, Mademoiselle.”
        “That implies a detached attitude. I think my attitude is more selfish.
        I have learned to save myself useless emotion.” She was speaking more to
        herself than to him. She was not even looking at him. Her gaze went past
        him, out of the window to where the snow lay in heavy masses. “You are a
        strong character, Mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently. “You are, I think,
        the strongest character amongst us.” “Oh! no. No, indeed. I know one
        far, far stronger than I am.” “And that is-?” She seemed suddenly to
        come to herself, to realise that she was talking to a stranger and
        foreigner, with whom, until this morning, she had exchanged only half a
        dozen sentences. She laughed, a polite but estranging laugh. “Well -
        that old lady, for instance. You have probably noticed her. A very ugly
        old lady but rather fascinating. She has only to lift a little finger
        and ask for something in a polite voice - and the whole train runs.” “It
        runs also for my friend M. Bouc,” said Poirot. “But that is because he
        is a director of the line, not because he has a strong character.” Mary
        Debenham smiled. The morning wore away. Several people, Poirot amongst
        them, remained in the dining-car. The communal life was felt, at the
        moment, to pass the time better. He heard a good deal more about Mrs.
        Hubbard’s daughter, and he heard the lifelong habits of Mr. Hubbard,
        deceased, from his rising in the morning and commencing breakfast with a
        cereal to his final rest at night in the bed-socks that Mrs. Hubbard
        herself had been in the habit of knitting for him. It was when he was
        listening to a confused account of the missionary aims of the Swedish
        lady that one of the Wagon Lit conductors came into the car and stood at
        his elbow. “Pardon, Monsieur.” “Yes?” “The compliments of M. Bouc, and
        he would be glad if you would be so kind as to come to him for a few
        minutes.” Poirot rose, uttered excuses to the Swedish lady and followed
        the man out of the dining-car. It was not his own conductor, but a big
        fair man. He followed his guide down the corridor of his own carriage
        and along the corridor of the next one. The man tapped at a door, then
        stood aside to let Poirot enter. The compartment was not M. Bouc’s own.
        It was a second-class one - chosen presumably because of its slightly
        larger size. It certainly gave the impression of being crowded. M. Bouc
        himself was sitting on the small seat in the opposite corner. In the
        corner next the window, facing him, was a small dark man looking out at
        the snow. Standing up and quite preventing Poirot from advancing any
        farther were a big man in blue uniform (the chef de train ) and his own
        Wagon Lit conductor. “Ah! my good friend,” cried M. Bouc. “Come in. We
        have need of you.” The little man in the window shifted along the seat,
        and Poirot squeezed past: the other two men and sat down facing his
        friend. The expression on M. Bouc’s face gave him, as he would have
        expressed it, furiously to think. It was clear that something out of the
        common had happened. “What has occurred?” he asked. “You may well ask
        that. First this snow - this stoppage. And now-” He paused - and a sort
        of strangled gasp came from the Wagon Lit conductor. “And now what?”
        “And now a passenger lies dead in his berth - stabbed.” M. Bouc spoke
        with a kind of calm desperation. “A passenger? Which passenger?” “An
        American. A man called - called-” he consulted some notes in front of
        him. “Ratchett. That is right - Ratchett?” “Yes, Monsieur,” the Wagon
        Lit man gulped. Poirot looked at him. He was as white as chalk. “You had
        better let that man sit down,” he said. “He may faint otherwise.” The
        chef de train moved slightly and the Wagon Lit man sank down in the
        corner and buried his face in his hands. “Brr!” said Poirot. “This is
        serious!” “Certainly it is serious. To begin with, a murder - that in
        itself is a calamity of the first water. But not only that, the
        circumstances are unusual. Here we are, brought to a standstill. We may
        be here for hours - and not only hours - days! Another circumstance -
        passing through most countries we have the police of that country on the
        train. But in Jugo-Slavia, no. You comprehend?” “It is a position of
        great difficulty,” said Poirot. “There is worse to come. Dr. Constantine
        - I forgot, I have not introduced you. Dr. Constantine, M. Poirot.” The
        little dark man bowed, and Poirot returned the bow. “Dr. Constantine is
        of the opinion that death occurred at about 1 A.M.” “It is difficult to
        speak exactly in these matters,” said the doctor, “but I think I can say
        definitely that death occurred between midnight and two in the morning.”
        “When was this M. Ratchett last seen alive?” asked Poirot. “He is known
        to have been alive at about twenty minutes to one, when he spoke to the
        conductor,” said M. Bouc. “That is quite correct,” said Poirot. “I
        myself heard what passed. That is the last thing known?” “Yes.” Poirot
        turned toward the doctor, who continued. “The window of M. Ratchett’s
        compartment was found wide open, leading one to suppose that the
        murderer escaped that way. But in my opinion that open window is a
        blind. Anyone departing that way would have left distinct traces in the
        snow. There were none.” “The crime was discovered - when?” asked Poirot.
        “Michel!” The Wagon Lit conductor sat up. His face still looked pale and
        frightened. “Tell this gentleman exactly what occurred,” ordered M.
        Bouc. The man spoke somewhat jerkily. “The valet of this M. Ratchett, he
        tapped several times at the door this morning. There was no answer.
        Then, half an hour ago, the restaurant car attendant came. He wanted to
        know if Monsieur was taking dejeuner. It was eleven o’clock, you
        comprehend. “I open the door for him with my key. But there is a chain,
        too, and that is fastened. There is no answer and it is very still in
        there, and cold - but cold. With the window open and snow drifting in. I
        thought the gentleman had had a fit, perhaps. I got the chef de train.
        We broke the chain and went in. He was - Ah! c’etait terrible !” He
        buried his face in his hands again. “The door was locked and chained on
        the inside,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “It was not suicide - eh?” The
        Greek doctor gave a sardonic laugh. “Does a man who commits suicide stab
        himself in ten-twelve-fifteen places?” he asked. Poirot’s eyes opened.
        “That is great ferocity,” he said. “It is a woman,” said the chef de
        train, speaking for the first time. “Depend upon it, it was a woman.
        Only a woman would stab like that.” Dr. Constantine screwed up his face
        thoughtfully. “She must have been a very strong woman,” he said. “It is
        not my desire to speak technically - that is only confusing; but I can
        assure you that one or two of the blows were delivered with such force
        as to drive them through hard belts of bone and muscle.” “It was clearly
        not a scientific crime,” said Poirot. “It was most unscientific,”
        returned Dr. Constantine. “The blows seem to have been delivered
        haphazard and at random. Some have glanced off, doing hardly any damage.
        It is as though somebody had shut his eyes and then in a frenzy struck
        blindly again and again.” “C’est une femme,” said the chef de train
        again. “Women are like that. When they are enraged they have great
        strength.” He nodded so sagely that everyone suspected a personal
        experience of his own. “I have, perhaps, something to contribute to your
        store of knowledge,” said Poirot. “M. Ratchett spoke to me yesterday. He
        told me, as far as I was able to understand him, that he was in danger
        of his life.” “ 'Bumped off 5 - that is the American expression, is it
        not?” asked M. Bouc. “Then it is not a woman. It is a ‘gangster’ or a
        ‘gunman.’ ” The chef de train looked pained at seeing his theory come to
        nought. “If so,” said Poirot, “it seems to have been done very
        amateurishly.” His tone expressed professional disapproval. “There is a
        large American on the train,.” said M. Bouc, pursuing his idea. “A
        common-looking man with terrible clothes. He chews the gum, which I
        believe is not done in good circles. You know whom I mean?” The Wagon
        Lit conductor to whom he had appealed nodded. “Ouz, Monsieur, the No.
        16. But it cannot have been he. I should have seen him enter or leave
        the compartment.” “You might not. You might not. But we will go into
        that presently. The question is, what to do?” He looked at Poirot.
        Poirot looked back at him. “Come, my friend,” said M. Bouc. “You
        comprehend what I am about to ask of you. I know your powers. Take
        command of this investigation! No, no, do not refuse. See, to us it is
        serious - I speak for the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits. By
        the time the Jugo-Slavian police arrive, how simple if we can present
        them with the solution! Otherwise delays, annoyances, a million and one
        inconveniences. Perhaps, who knows, serious annoyance to innocent
        persons. Instead - you solve the mystery! We say, ‘A murder has occurred
        - this is the criminal!”’ “And suppose I do not solve it?” “Ah, mon
        cher\ ” M. Bouc’s voice became positively caressing. “I know your
        reputation. I know something of your methods. This is the ideal case for
        you. To look up the antecedents of all these people, to discover their
        bona fides - all that takes time and endless inconvenience. But have I
        not heard you say often that to solve a case a man has only to lie back
        in his chair and think? Do that. Interview the passengers on the train,
        view the body, examine what clues there are, and then - well, I have
        faith in you! I am assured that it is no idle boast of yours. Lie back
        and think - use (as I have heard you say so often) the little grey cells
        of the mind - and you will know!” He leaned forward, looking
        affectionately at the detective. “Your faith touches me, my friend,”
        said Poirot emotionally. “As you say, this cannot be a difficult case. I
        myself last night - but we will not speak of that now. In truth, this
        problem intrigues me. I was reflecting, not half an hour ago, that many
        hours of boredom lay ahead whilst we are stuck here. And now - a problem
        lies ready to my hand.” “You accept then?” said M. Bouc eagerly. “C’est
        entendu. You place the matter in my hands.” “Good - we are all at your
        service.” “To begin with, I should like a plan of the Istanbul-Calais
        coach, with a note of the people who occupied the several compartments,
        and I should also like to see their passports and their tickets.”
        “Michel will get you those.” The Wagon Lit conductor left the
        compartment. “What other passengers are there on the train?” asked
        Poirot. “In this coach Dr. Constantine and I are the only travellers. In
        the coach from Bucharest is an old gentleman with a lame leg. He is well
        known to the conductor. Beyond that are the ordinary carriages, but
        these do not concern us, since they were locked after dinner had been
        served last night. Forward of the Istanbul-Calais coach there is only
        the dining-car.” “Then it seems,” said Poirot slowly, “as though we must
        look for our murderer in the Istanbul-Calais coach.” He turned to the
        doctor. “That is what you were hinting, I think?” The Greek nodded. “At
        half an hour after midnight we ran into the snowdrift. No one can have
        left the train since then.” M. Bouc said solemnly, “The murderer is with
        us - on the train now...” 6. A Woman “First of all,” said Poirot, “I
        should like a word or two with young Mr. MacQueen. He may be able to
        give us valuable information.” “Certainly,” said M. Bouc. He turned to
        the chef de train. “Get Mr. MacQueen to come here.” The chef de train
        left the carriage. The conductor returned with a bundle of passports and
        tickets. M. Bouc took them from him. “Thank you, Michel. It would be
        best now, I think, if you were to go back to your post. We will take
        your evidence formally later.” “Very good, Monsieur,” said Michel, and
        in his turn left the carriage. “After we have seen young MacQueen,” said
        Poirot, “perhaps M. le docteur will come with me to the dead man’s
        carriage.” “Certainly.” “After we have finished there-” But at this
        moment the chef de train returned with Hector MacQueen. M. Bouc rose.
        “We are a little cramped here,” he said pleasantly. “Take my seat, Mr.
        MacQueen. M. Poirot will sit opposite you - so.” He turned to the chef
        de train. “Clear all the people out of the restaurant car,” he said,
        “and let it be left free for M. Poirot. You will conduct your interviews
        there, mon cher ?” “It would be the most convenient, yes,” agreed
        Poirot. MacQueen had stood looking from one to the other, not quite
        following the rapid flow of French. “Qu’est - ce qu’ily a?” he began
        laboriously. “ Pourquoi '-?” With a vigorous gesture Poirot motioned him
        to the seat in the corner. He took it and began once more. “Pourquoi-?”
        Then checking himself and relapsing into his own tongue: “What’s up on
        the train? Has anything happened?” He looked from one man to another.
        Poirot nodded. “Exactly. Something has happened. Prepare yourself for a
        shock. Your employer, M. Ratchett, is dead\” MacQueen’s mouth pursed
        itself into a whistle. Except that his eyes grew a shade brighter, he
        showed no signs of shock or distress. “So they got him after all,” he
        said. “What exactly do you mean by that phrase, Mr. MacQueen?” MacQueen
        hesitated. “You are assuming,” said Poirot, “that M. Ratchett was
        murdered?” “Wasn’t he?” This time MacQueen did show surprise. “Why,
        yes,” he said slowly. “That’s just what I did think. Do you mean he just
        died in his sleep? Why, the old man was as tough as - as tough-” He
        stopped, at a loss for a simile. “No, no,” said Poirot. “Your assumption
        was quite right. M. Ratchett was murdered. Stabbed. But I should like to
        know why you were so sure it was murder, and not just - death.” MacQueen
        hesitated. “I must get this clear,” he said. “Who exactly are you? And
        where do you come in?” “I represent the Compagnie Internationale des
        Wagons Lits.” Poirot paused, then added, “I am a detective. My name is
        Hercule Poirot.” If he expected an effect he did not get one. MacQueen
        said merely, “Oh! yes?” and waited for him to go on. “You know the name
        perhaps?” “Why, it does seem kind of familiar. Only I always thought it
        was a woman’s dressmaker.” Hercule Poirot looked at him with distaste.
        “It is incredible!” he said. “What’s incredible?” “Nothing. Let us
        advance with the matter in hand. I want you to tell me, M. MacQueen, all
        that you know about the dead man. You were not related to him?” “No. I
        am - was - his secretary.” “For how long have you held that post?” “Just
        over a year.” “Please give me all the information you can.” “Well, I met
        Mr. Ratchett just over a year ago when I was in Persia-” Poirot
        interrupted. “What were you doing there?’ “I had come over from New York
        to look into an oil concession. I don’t suppose you want to hear all
        about that. My friends and I had been let in rather badly over it. Mr.
        Ratchett was in the same hotel. He had just had a row with his
        secretary. He offered me the job and I took it. I was at a loose end and
        glad to find a well-paid job ready made, as it were.” “And since then?”
        “We’ve travelled about. Mr. Ratchett wanted to see the world. He was
        hampered by knowing no languages. I acted more as a courier than as a
        secretary. It was a pleasant life.” “Now tell me as much as you can
        about your employer.” The young man shrugged his shoulders. A perplexed
        expression passed over his face. “That’s not so easy.” “What was his
        full name?” “Samuel Edward Ratchett.” “He was an American citizen?”
        “Yes.” “What part of America did he come from?” “I don’t know.” “Well,
        tell me what you do know.” “The actual truth is, Mr. Poirot, that I know
        nothing at all! Mr. Ratchett never spoke of himself or of his life in
        America.” “Why do you think that was?” “I don’t know. I imagined that he
        might be ashamed of his beginnings. Some men are.” “Does that strike you
        as a satisfactory solution?” “Frankly, it doesn’t.” “Has he any
        relatives?” “He never mentioned any.” Poirot pressed the point. “You
        must have formed some theory, Mr. MacQueen.” “Well, Yes, I did. For one
        thing, I don’t believe Ratchett was his real name. I think he left
        America definitely in order to escape someone or something. I think he
        was successful - until a few weeks ago.” “And then?” “He began to get
        letters - threatening letters.” “Did you see them?” “Yes. It was my
        business to attend to his correspondence. The first letter came a
        fortnight ago.” “Were these letters destroyed?” “No, I think I’ve got a
        couple still in my files - one I know Ratchett tore up in a rage. Shall
        I get them for you?” “If you would be so good.” MacQueen left the
        compartment. He returned a few minutes later and laid down two sheets of
        rather dirty notepaper before Poirot. The first letter ran as follows:
        Thought you’d double-cross us and get away with it, did you? Not on your
        life. We’re out to GET you, Ratchett, and we WILL get you! There was no
        signature. With no comment beyond raised eyebrows, Poirot picked up the
        second letter. We’re going to take you for a ride, Ratchett. Some time
        soon. We’re going to GET you - see ? Poirot laid the letter down. “The
        style is monotonous!” he said. “More so than the handwriting.” MacQueen
        stared at him. “You would not observe,” said Poirot pleasantly. “It
        requires the eye of one used to such things. This letter was not written
        by one person, M. MacQueen. Two or more persons wrote it - each writing
        one letter of a word at a time. Also, the letters are printed. That
        makes the task of identifying the handwriting much more difficult.” He
        paused, then said: “Did you know that M. Ratchett had applied for help
        to me?” “To you?” MacQueen’s astonished tone told Poirot quite certainly
        that the young man had not known of it. The detective nodded. “Yes. He
        was alarmed. Tell me, how did he act when he received the first letter?”
        MacQueen hesitated. “It’s difficult to say. He - he - passed it off with
        a laugh in that quiet way of his. But somehow-” he gave a slight shiver
        - “I felt that there was a good deal going on underneath the quietness.”
        Poirot nodded. Then he asked an unexpected question. “Mr. MacQueen, will
        you tell me, quite honestly, exactly how you regarded your employer? Did
        you like him?” Hector MacQueen took a moment or two before replying.
        “No,” he said at last. “I did not.” “Why.” “I can’t exactly say. He was
        always quite pleasant in his manner.” He paused, then said: “I’ll tell
        you the truth, Mr. Poirot. I disliked and distrusted him. He was, I am
        sure, a cruel and dangerous man. I must admit, though, that I have no
        reasons to advance for my opinion.” “Thank you, Mr. MacQueen. One
        further question: when did you last see Mr. Ratchett alive?” “Last
        evening about-” he thought for a minute - “ten o’clock, I should say. I
        went into his compartment to take down some memoranda from him.” “On
        what subject?” “Some tiles and antique pottery that he bought inPersia.
        What had been delivered was not what he had purchased. There has been a
        long, vexatious correspondence on the subject.” “And that was the last
        time Mr. Ratchett was seen alive?” “Yes, I suppose so.” “Do you know
        when Mr. Ratchett received the last threatening letter?” “On the morning
        of the day we left Constantinople.” “There is one more question I must
        ask you, Mr. MacQueen. Were you on good terms with your employer?” The
        young man’s eyes twinkled suddenly. “This is where I’m supposed to go
        all goosefleshy down the back. In the words of a best seller, 'You’ve
        nothing on me.’ Ratchett and I were on perfectly good terms.” “Perhaps,
        Mr. MacQueen, you will give me your full name and your address in
        America.” MacQueen gave his name - Hector Willard MacQueen - and an
        address in New York. Poirot leaned back against the cushions. “That is
        all for the present, Mr. MacQueen,” he said. “I should be obliged if you
        would keep the matter of Mr. Ratchett’s death to yourself for a little
        time.” “His valet, Masterman, will have to know.” “He probably knows
        already,” said Poirot drily. “If so, try to get him to hold his tongue.”
        “That oughtn’t to be difficult. He’s a Britisher and, as he calls it, he
        'keeps to himself.’ He has a low opinion of Americans, and no opinion at
        all of any other nationality.” “Thank you, Mr. MacQueen.” The American
        left the carriage. “Well?” demanded M. Bouc. “You believe what he says,
        this young man?” “He seems honest and straightforward. He did not
        pretend to any affection for his employer, as he probably would have
        done had he been involved in any way. It is true, Mr. Ratchett did not
        tell him that he had tried to enlist my services and failed, but I do
        not think that that is really a suspicious circumstance. I fancy Mr.
        Ratchett was a gentleman who kept his own counsel on every possible
        occasion.” “So you pronounce one person at least innocent of the crime,”
        said M. Bouc jovially. Poirot cast on him a look of reproach. “Me, I
        suspect everybody till the last minute,” he said. “All the same, I must
        admit that I cannot see this sober, long-headed MacQueen losing his head
        and stabbing his victim twelve or fourteen times. It is not in accord
        with his psychology - not at all.” “No,” said M. Bouc thoughtfully.
        “That is the act of a man driven almost crazy with a frenzied hate - it
        suggests rather the Latin temperament. Or else it suggests, as our
        friend the chef de train insisted - a woman.” 7. The Body Followed by
        Dr. Constantine, Poirot made his way to the next coach and to the
        compartment occupied by the murdered man. The conductor came and
        unlocked the door for them with his key. The two men passed inside.
        Poirot turned inquiringly to his companion. “How much has been
        disarranged in this compartment?” “Nothing has been touched. I was
        careful not to move the body in making my examination.” Poirot nodded.
        He looked round him. The first thing that struck the senses was the
        intense cold. The window was pushed down as far as it would go, and the
        blind was drawn up. “Brrr,” observed Poirot. The other smiled
        appreciatively. “I did not like to close it,” he said. Poirot examined
        the window carefully. “You are right,” he announced. “Nobody left the
        carriage this way. Possibly the open window was intended to suggest that
        somebody did; but if so, the snow has defeated the murderer’s
        intention.” He examined the frame of the window carefully. Taking a
        small case from his pocket he blew a little powder over the frame. “No
        fingerprints at all,” he said. “That means it: has been wiped. Well, if
        there had been fingerprints they would have told us very little. They
        would have been those of Mr. Ratchett or his valet or the conductor.
        Criminals do not make mistakes of that kind nowadays. “And that being
        so,” he added cheerfully, “we might as well shut the window. Positively
        it is the cold storage in here!” He suited the action to the word and
        then turned his attention for the first time to the motionless figure
        lying in the bunk. Ratchett lay on his back. His pyjama jacket, stained
        with rusty patches, had been unbuttoned and thrown back. “I had to see
        the nature of the wounds, you see,” explained the doctor. Poirot nodded.
        He bent over the body. Finally he straightened himself with a slight
        grimace. “It is not pretty,” he said. “Someone must have stood there and
        stabbed him again and again. How many wounds are there exactly?” “I make
        it twelve. One or two are so slight as to be practically scratches. On
        the other hand, at least three would be capable of causing death.”
        Something in the doctor’s tone caught Poirot’s attention. He looked at
        him sharply. The little Greek was standing staring down at the body with
        a puzzled frown. “Something strikes you as odd, does it not?” he asked
        gently. “Speak, my friend. There is something here that puzzles you?”
        “You are right,” acknowledged the other. “What is it?” “You see these
        two wounds - here and here-” He pointed. “They are deep. Each cut must
        have severed blood vessels - and yet the edges do not gape. They have
        not bled as one would have expected.” “Which suggests?” “That the man
        was already dead - some little time dead - when they were delivered. But
        that is surely absurd.” “It would seem so,” said Poirot thoughtfully.
        “Unless our murderer figured to himself that he had not accomplished his
        job properly and came back to make quite sure - but that is manifestly
        absurd! Anything else?” “Well, just one thing.” “And that?” “You see
        this wound here - under the right arm - near the right shoulder. Take
        this pencil of mine. Could you deliver such a blow?” Poirot poised his
        hand. “Precisement,” he said. “I see. With the right hand it is
        exceedingly difficult, almost impossible. One would have to strike
        backhanded, as it were. But if the blow were struck with the left hand-”
        “Exactly, M. Poirot. That blow was almost certainly struck with the left
        hand.” “So that our murderer is left-handed? No, it is more difficult
        than that, is it not?” “As you say, M. Poirot. Some of these other blows
        are just as obviously right-handed.” “Two people. We are back at two
        people again,” murmured the detective. He asked abruptly: “Was the
        electric light on?” “It is difficult to say. You see, it is turned off
        by the conductor every morning about ten o’clock.” “The switches will
        tell us,” said Poirot. He examined the switch of the top light and also
        the roll-back bed-head light. The former was turned off. The latter was
        closed. “Eh hien ,” he said thoughtfully. “We have here a hypothesis of
        the First and the Second Murderer, as the great Shakespeare would put
        it. The First Murderer stabbed his victim and left the compartment,
        turning off the light. The Second Murderer came in in the dark, did not
        see that his or her work had been done, and stabbed at least twice at a
        dead body. Que pensez - vous de gal” “Magnificent!” said the little
        doctor with enthusiasm. The other’s eyes twinkled. “You think so? I am
        glad. It sounded to me a little like the nonsense.” “What other
        explanation can there be?” “That is just what I am asking myself. Have
        we here a coincidence, or what? Are there any other inconsistencies,
        such as would point to two people being concerned?” “I think I can say
        yes. Some of these blows, as I have already said, point to a weakness -
        a lack of strength or a lack of determination. They are feeble, glancing
        blows. But this one here - and this one-” Again he pointed. “Great
        strength was needed for those blows. They have penetrated the muscle.”
        “They were, in your opinion, delivered by a man?” “Most certainly.”
        “They could not have been delivered by a woman?” “A young, vigorous,
        athletic woman might have struck them, especially if she were in the
        grip of a strong emotion; but it is in my opinion highly unlikely.”
        Poirot was silent a moment or two. The other asked anxiously, “You
        understand my point?” “Perfectly,” said Poirot. “The matter begins to
        clear itself up wonderfully! The murderer was a man of great strength -
        he was feeble - it was a woman - it was a right-handed person - it was a
        left-handed person. Ah! c’est rigolo, tout cal” He spoke with sudden
        anger. “And the victim - what does he do in all this? Does he cry out?
        Does he struggle? Does he defend himself?” He slipped his hand under the
        pillow and drew out the automatic pistol which Ratchett had shown him
        the day before. “Fully loaded, you see,” he said. They looked round
        them. Ratchett’s day clothing was hanging from the hooks on the wall. On
        the small table formed by the lid of the wash basin were various
        objects. False teeth in a glass of water. Another glass, empty. A bottle
        of mineral water. A large flask. An ash-tray containing the butt of a
        cigar and some charred fragments of paper; also two burnt matches. The
        doctor picked up the empty glass and sniffed it. “Here is the
        explanation of the victim’s inertia,” he said quietly. “Drugged?” “Yes.”
        Poirot nodded. He picked up the two matches and scrutinised them
        carefully. “You have a clue then?” demanded the little doctor eagerly.
        “Those two matches are of different shapes,” said Poirot. “One is
        flatter than the other. You see?” “It is the kind you get on the train,”
        said the doctor. “In paper covers.” Poirot was feeling in the pockets of
        Ratchett’s clothing. Presently he pulled out a box of matches. He
        compared them carefully with the burnt ones. “The rounder one is a match
        struck by Mr. Ratchett,” he said. “Let us see if he had also the flatter
        kind.” But a further search showed no other matches. Poirot’s eyes were
        darting about the compartment. They were bright and sharp like a bird’s.
        One felt that nothing could escape their scrutiny. With a little
        exclamation he bent and picked-up something from the floor. It was a
        small square of cambric, very dainty. In the corner was an embroidered
        initial - H. “A woman’s handkerchief,” said the doctor. “Our friend the
        chef de train was right. There is a woman concerned in this.” “And most
        conveniently she leaves her handkerchief behind!” said Poirot. “Exactly
        as it happens in the books and on the films - and to make things even
        easier for us, it is marked with an initial.” “What a stroke of luck for
        us!” exclaimed the doctor. “Is it not?” said Poirot. Something in his
        tone surprised the doctor, but before he could ask for elucidation
        Poirot had made another dive onto the floor. This time he held out on
        the palm of his hand - a pipe-cleaner. “It is perhaps the property of
        Mr. Ratchett?” suggested the doctor. “There was no pipe in any of his
        pockets, and no tobacco or tobacco pouch.” “Then it is a clue.” “Oh!
        decidedly. And again dropped most conveniently. A masculine clue, this
        time, you note! One cannot complain of having no clues in this case.
        There are clues here in abundance. By the way, what have you done with
        the weapon?” “There was no sign of any weapon. The murderer must have
        taken it away with him.” “I wonder why,” mused Poirot. “Ah!” The doctor
        had been delicately exploring the pyjama pockets of the dead man. “I
        overlooked this,” he said. “I unbuttoned the jacket and threw it
        straight back.” From the breast pocket he brought out a gold watch. The
        case was dented savagely, and the hands pointed to a quarter past one.
        “You see?” cried Constantine eagerly. “This gives us the hour of the
        crime. It agrees with my calculations. Between midnight and two in the
        morning is what I said, and probably about one o’clock, though it is
        difficult to be exact in these matters.Eh bien, here is confirmation. A
        quarter past one. That was the hour of the crime.” “It is possible, yes.
        It is certainly possible.” The doctor looked at him curiously. “You will
        pardon me, M. Poirot, but I do not quite understand you.” “I do not
        understand myself,” said Poirot. “I understand nothing at all. And, as
        you perceive, it worries me.” He sighed and bent over the little table
        examining the charred fragment of paper. He murmured to himself, “What I
        need at this moment is an old-fashioned woman’s hat-box.” Dr.
        Constantine was at a loss to know what to make of this singular remark.
        In any case Poirot gave him no time for questions. Opening the door into
        the corridor, he called for the conductor. The man arrived at a run.
        “How many women are there in this coach?” The conductor counted on his
        fingers. “One, two, three - six, Monsieur. The old American lady, a
        Swedish lady, the young English lady, the Countess Andrenyi, and Madame
        la Princesse Dragomiroff and her maid.” Poirot considered. “They all
        have hat-boxes, yes?” “Yes, Monsieur.” “Then bring me - let me see -
        yes, the Swedish lady’s and that of the lady’s- maid. Those two are the
        only hope. You will tell them it is a customs regulation - something -
        anything that occurs to you.” “That will be all right, Monsieur. Neither
        lady is in her compartment at the moment.” “Then be quick.” The
        conductor departed. He returned with the two hatboxes. Poirot opened
        that of the maid, and tossed it aside. Then he opened the Swedish lady’s
        and uttered an exclamation of satisfaction. Removing the hats carefully,
        he disclosed round humps of wire-netting. “Ah, here is what we need!
        About fifteen years ago hat-boxes were made like this. You skewered
        through the hat with a hatpin on to this hump of wire¬ netting.” As he
        spoke he was skillfully removing two of the attached humps. Then he
        repacked the hat-box and told the conductor to return both boxes where
        they belonged. When the door was shut once more he turned to his
        companion. “See you, my dear doctor, me, I am not one to rely upon the
        expert procedure. It is the psychology I seek, not the fingerprint or
        the cigarette ash. But in this case I would welcome a little scientific
        assistance. This compartment is full of clues, but can I be sure that
        those clues are really what they seem to be?” “I do not quite understand
        you, M. Poirot.” “Well, to give you an example - we find a woman’s
        handkerchief. Did a woman drop it? Or did a man, committing the crime,
        say to himself: ‘I will make this look like a woman’s crime. I will stab
        my enemy an unnecessary number of times, making some of the blows feeble
        and ineffective, and I will drop this handkerchief where no one can miss
        it’? That is one possibility. Then there is another. Did a woman kill
        him, and did she deliberately drop a pipe-cleaner to make it look like a
        man’s work? Or are we seriously to suppose that two people, a man and a
        woman, were separately concerned, and that each was so careless as to
        drop a clue to his or her identity? It is a little too much of a
        coincidence, that!” “But where does the hat-box come in?” asked the
        doctor, still puzzled. “Ah! I am coming to that. As I say, these clues -
        the watch stopped at a quarter past one, the handkerchief, the
        pipe-cleaner - they may be genuine, or they may be faked. As to that I
        cannot yet tell. But there is one clue here which - though again I may
        be wrong - I believe has not been faked. I mean this flat match, M. le
        docteur. I believe that that match was used by the murderer, not by Mr.
        Ratchett. It was used to burn an incriminating paper of some kind.
        Possibly a note. If so, there was something in that note, some mistake,
        some error, that left a possible clue to the assailant. I am going to
        try to discover what that something was.” He went out of the compartment
        and returned a few moments later with a small spirit stove and a pair of
        curling-tongs. “I use them for the moustaches,” he said, referring to
        the latter. The doctor watched him with great interest. Poirot flattened
        out the two humps of wire, and with great care wriggled the charred
        scrap of paper on to one of them. He clapped the other on top of it and
        then, holding both pieces together with the tongs, held the whole thing
        over the flame of the spirit-lamp. “It is a very makeshift affair,
        this,” he said over his shoulder. “Let us hope that it will answer our
        purpose.” The doctor watched the proceedings attentively. The metal
        began to glow. Suddenly he saw faint indications of letters. Words
        formed themselves slowly - words of fire. It was a very tiny scrap. Only
        three words and part of another showed. -member little Daisy Armstrong
        “Ah!” Poirot gave a sharp exclamation. “It tells you something?” asked
        the doctor. Poirot’s eyes were shining. He laid down the tongs
        carefully. “Yes,” he said. “I know the dead man’s real name. I know why
        he had to leave America.” “What was his name?” “Cassetti.” “Cassetti?”
        Constantine knitted his brows. “It brings back to me something. Some
        years ago. I cannot remember... It was a case in America, was it not?”
        “Yes,” said Poirot. “A case in America.” Further than that Poirot was
        not disposed to be communicative. He looked round him as he went on: “We
        will go into all that presently. Let us first make sure that we have
        seen all there is to be seen here.” Quickly and deftly he went once more
        through the pockets of the dead man’s clothes but found nothing there of
        interest. He tried the communicating door which led through to the next
        compartment, but it was bolted on the other side. “There is one thing
        that I do not understand,” said Dr. Constantine. “If the murderer did
        not escape through the window, and if this communicating door was bolted
        on the other side, and if the door into the corridor was not only locked
        on the inside but chained, how then did the murderer leave the
        compartment?” “That is what the audience says when a person bound hand
        and foot is shut into a cabinet - and disappears.” “You mean-?” “I
        mean,” explained Poirot, “that if the murderer intended us to believe
        that he had escaped by way of the window, he would naturally make it
        appear that the other two exits were impossible. Like the ‘disappearing
        person’ in the cabinet, it is a trick. It is our business to find out
        how the trick is done. He locked the communicating door on their side -
        “in case,” he said, “the excellent Mrs. Hubbard should take it into her
        head to acquire first-hand details of the crime to write to her
        daughter.” He looked round once more. “There is nothing more to do here,
        I think. Let us rejoin M. Bouc.” 8. The Armstrong Kidnapping Case They
        found M. Bouc finishing an omelet. “I thought it best to have lunch
        served immediately in the restaurant car,” he said. “Afterwards it will
        be cleared and M. Poirot can conduct his examination of the passengers
        there. In the meantime I have ordered them to bring us three some food
        here.” “An excellent idea,” said Poirot. None of the three men was
        hungry, and the meal was soon eaten; but not till they were sipping
        their coffee did M. Bouc mention the subject that was occupying all
        their minds. “Eh bien ?” he asked. “Eh bien, I have discovered the
        identity of the victim. I know why it was imperative he should leave
        America.” “Who was he?” “Do you remember reading of the Armstrong baby?
        This is the man who murdered little Daisy Armstrong. Cassetti.” “I
        recall it now. A shocking affair - though I cannot remember the
        details.” “Colonel Armstrong was an Englishman - a V.C. He was half
        American, his mother having been a daughter of W. K. Van der Halt, the
        Wall Street millionaire. He married the daughter of Linda Arden, the
        most famous tragic American actress of her day. They lived in America
        and had one child - a girl whom they idolized. When she was three years
        old she was kidnapped, and an impossibly high sum demanded as the price
        of her return. I will not weary you with all the intricacies that
        followed. I will come to the moment when, after the parents had paid
        over the enormous sum of two hundred thousand dollars, the child’s dead
        body was discovered; it had been dead for at least a fortnight. Public
        indignation rose to fever point. And there was worse to follow. Mrs.
        Armstrong was expecting another baby. Following the shock of the
        discovery, she gave birth prematurely to a dead child, and herself died.
        Her broken-hearted husband shot himself.” “Mon Dieu, what a tragedy. I
        remember now,” said M. Bouc. “There was also another death, if I
        remember rightly?” “Yes, an unfortunate French or Swiss nursemaid. The
        police were convinced that she had some knowledge of the crime. They
        refused to believe her hysterical denials. Finally, in a fit of despair
        the poor girl threw herself from a window and was killed. It was proved
        afterwards that she had been absolutely innocent of any complicity in
        the crime.” “It is not good to think of,” said M. Bouc. “About six
        months later, this man Cassetti was arrested as the head of the gang who
        had kidnapped the child. They had used the same methods in the past. If
        the police seemed likely to get on their trail, they killed their
        prisoner, hid the body, and continued to extract as much money as
        possible before the crime was discovered. “Now, I will make clear to you
        this, my friend. Cassetti was the man! But by means of the enormous
        wealth he had piled up, and owing to the secret hold he had over various
        persons, he was acquitted on some technical inaccuracy. Notwithstanding
        that, he would have been lynched by the populace had he not been clever
        enough to give them the slip. It is now clear to me what happened. He
        changed his name and left America. Since then he has been a gentleman of
        leisure, travelling abroad and living on his rentes.” “Ah! quel animal
        !” M. Bouc’s tone was redolent of heartfelt disgust. “I cannot regret
        that he is dead - not at all!” “I agree with you.” “Tout de meme, it is
        not necessary that he should be killed on the Orient Express. There are
        other places.” Poirot smiled a little. He realised that M. Bouc was
        biased in the matter. “The question we have now to ask ourselves is
        this,” he said. “Is this murder the work of some rival gang whom
        Cassetti had double-crossed in the past, or is it an act of private
        vengeance?” He explained his discovery of the few words on the charred
        fragment of paper. “If I am right in my assumption, then, the letter was
        burnt by the murderer. Why? Because it mentioned the name ‘Armstrong/
        which is the clue to the mystery.” “Are there any members of the
        Armstrong family living?” “That, unfortunately, I do not know. I think I
        remember reading of a younger sister of Mrs. Armstrong’s.” Poirot went
        on to relate the joint conclusions of himself and Dr. Constantine. M.
        Bouc brightened at the mention of the broken watch. “That seems to give
        us the time of the crime very exactly.” “Yes,” said Poirot. “It is very
        convenient.” There was an indescribable something in his tone that made
        both the other two look at him curiously. “You say that you yourself
        heard Ratchett speak to the conductor at twenty minutes to one?” asked
        M. Bouc. Poirot related just what had occurred. “Well,” said M. Bouc,
        “that proves at least that Cassetti - or Ratchett, as I shall continue
        to call him - was certainly alive at twenty minutes to one.”
        “Twenty-three minutes to one, to be precise.” Then at twelve
        thirty-seven, to put it formally, Mr. Ratchett was alive. That is one
        fact, at least.” Poirot did not reply. He sat looking thoughtfully in
        front of him. There was a tap on the door and the restaurant attendant
        entered. “The restaurant car is free now, Monsieur,” he said. “We will
        go there,” said M. Bouc, rising. “I may accompany you?” asked
        Constantine. “Certainly, my dear doctor. Unless M. Poirot has any
        objection?” “Not at all. Not at all,” said Poirot. After a little
        politeness in the matter of precedence - “Apres vous, Monsieur ” - “Mais
        non, apres vous” - they left the compartment.
